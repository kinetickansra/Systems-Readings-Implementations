## Operating Systems System Structures Algorithms

This contains implementation of Disk Scheduling Algorithms.

1. How to run a syscall?
2. How to add your own syscall in Linux Kernel?

Do you know any other algorithm which is present in books mentioned that I missed
writing here, open a issue in the repository or a PR with the code following the
current structure. For advanced algorithm implementation see [this](https://github.com/tapasweni-pathak/Systems-Readings-Implementations/tree/master/AOS/Conferences).

#### To run the codes

Right now run like normal cpp code.

```cpp
g++ file_name.cpp
./a.out
```

or if you want to provide output file

```
g++ -o output file_name.cpp
./output.out
```

#### TODO
1. Error handling and messages
2. Run C++ code like executable or add a Makefile
