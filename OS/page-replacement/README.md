## Operating Systems Page Replacement Algorithms

This contains implementation of Page Replacement Algorithms.

1. First In First Out
2. Least Recently Used
3. Optimal Page Replacement
4. Least Frequently Used
5. Least Recently Used
6. Most Frequently Used
7. Not Recently Used
8. Second Chance Page Replacement
9. Clock Page Replacement
10. Working Set Page Replacement

The programs output the number of faults while serving a sequence of page requests
following the algorithm. Do you know any other algorithm which is present in the books
open a issue in the repository or a PR with the code following the current structure.

#### Structure of files and Some code info
Every algorithm is implemented as file-name.cpp.

#### To run the codes

Right now run like normal cpp code.

```cpp
g++ file_name.cpp
./a.out
```

or if you want to provide output file

```
g++ -o output file_name.cpp
./output.out
```

#### TODO
1. Error handling and messages
2. Run C++ code like executable or add a Makefile
