# implementations-and-notes

Notes, implementation in MINIX or Linux Kernel or independent implementation of
algorithm or simple visualization of personal Operating Systems, Distributed Computing
and/or Parallel Computing reading list.

Every folder has a readme with the description of what it contains and todos, covering

1. [OSDI](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/byname/179)
2. [SOSP](http://sosp.org/)
3. [USENIX ATC](https://www.usenix.org/publications/proceedings)
4. [EuroSys](https://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE101)
5. [PODC](https://www.podc.org/)
6. [ICDCS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7976702)



For anyone reading and finding the readings/notes useful/interesting
[there are many more conferences!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_science_conferences)
where you can find more things to read, I have been told these.

This repo also contains clone of Linux Kernel-4.17.11 and MINIX3 source code in which
I would be testing the implementation, the latest stable versions. Many papers are in
.ps form on the website, the folders in this repo would contain the pdf format.

Each reading has its own folder and would be having .patch if I was able to successfully
implement it in MINIX or Linux Kernel otherwise a independent implementation of the
algorithm or if not this then a simple visualization implementation of algorithm.

The source code is in C or C++ or Python or Javascript. The folder might just have a
flowchart or diagram using [mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) if I was not able
to implement anything listed above.
