# implementations-and-notes

Notes, implementation in MINIX or Linux Kernel or independent implementation of
algorithm or simple visualization of personal Operating Systems, Distributed Computing
and/or Parallel Computing reading list.

Every folder has a readme with the description of what it contains and todos, covering

2. [SOSP](http://sosp.org/)
3. [USENIX ATC](https://www.usenix.org/publications/proceedings)

[There are many more conferences!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_science_conferences) if you are looking
for more reading list items on these topics, I have been told these as most important
conferences.

This repo contains:
* Clone of Linux Kernel-4.17.11 and MINIX3.
* Papers in .pdf format
* Papers per conference per year folder
* Each folder contains
  * .patch if implemented
	* if not above then an independent implementation
	* if not above then a visualization implementation of algorithm.
	* if not above then a flowchart or diagram using [mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid).
